synopsis: " How to start loving ppt design, even though you'r a product designer"

The correct startup, provide great opportunities to grow and learn new things. You'd really enjoy working at one more if you were coming out from a stagnant, risk averse giant corporate job. But if you have spent a fair amount of time in a corporate, with set processes, nigh unlimited resources, and hyper-specialist coworkers, transitioning to a startup may need a little re-purposing. Here's a couple of things you may want to bear in mind, before making the jump.

**1**. **It's not just about applying your skills, It's about building a company**

Building a company needs you to behave as if you have skin in the game. **That means what you design will be heavily informed by what is needed to make your company successful.** **You will have to do bunch of non portfolio-able design**. Incredibly unglamorous, that design work is pivotal to build your company's credibility. Not exactly rockstar designer stuff, but extremely required to build your company's credibility and eventually bring in revenue. 

**2.  Generalist skills are more valuable**

If your goal is to do specialist work, an early stage startups may not be the place for you. If you are the sole designer, at any given moment, you'd be supporting product, also marketing, but also sales. Also operation. It tends to become overwhelming. Putting a positive spin on that, I would say that you'll most definitely have that coveted seat at the table designers covet. The downside to this is you may quickly become a blocker to the whole company. 

Here are a few things you can look forward to try out.

In decreasing order of excitement

- UX and UI design for product
- Brand and Identity design of your company for marketing.
- Infographics
- Presentation design for marketing and sales.
- Business document template designs. You know the contract, scope of work, report templates...the boring stuff that brings in the money. ( ðŸ˜ª ). This was new for me, but it gives you insight into how businesses are run.

Honestly I never thought I 'd see the day I would be designing power point presentations (ðŸ¤®), and I sure as hell would never have done it at a larger company. 

So if you are not too caught up in labels, and believe polymaths are a real thing and are frustrated by process, I would encourage you to explore joining a smaller company or startup ( These are not the same thing). But how does one select which startup to join. Aren't the majority of them destined to fail? 

That would be the topic of my next post.
